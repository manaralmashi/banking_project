# üè¶ Banking Projact (ASRM Bank CLI) üè¶

ASRM Bank CLI is a Python-based command-line application that provides a simulation of essential banking operations, text-based environment.  
This project showcases how core banking logic can be implemented in a clean, object-oriented design.


## üåü Features
### üîπ Account Management
- **Create New Account**: Register with checking, savings, or both account types
- **Login Security**: Access your account with automatically generated ID and password
- **Account Status**: View active/deactivated status with reactivation options

### üîπ Banking Operations
- **Withdraw Money**: From checking or savings accounts
- **Deposit Money**: Into existing or new accounts
- **Transfer Funds**: Between your accounts or to other customers
- **Check Balance**: Display current account balances in card
- **Account Information**: Display detailed account info in card

### üîπ Security Features
- **Password Validation**: Strong password requirements (8-15 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols)
- **Overdraft Protection**: Fees and limits for checking accounts
- **Account Reactivation**: Pay fees to restore access

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîπ Dependencies
* No extra dependencies are required ‚Äî just Python 3.x.

### üîπ Installing
* Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manaralmashi/banking_project.git
````

* Navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd banking_project
````

### üîπ Executing program
* Run the application from the terminal:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
>The system follows a clean object-oriented design:
>- **Customer Class**
>- **Account Class**
>- **BankManagement Class**
>- **Main Application**: User interface with intuitive menu navigation and error handling


## üìã Main Menu Options
>1. **Add New Customer** - Create bank account with initial deposit
>2. **Login Account** - Access your existing account, After Login Features:
>>    - **1. Withdraw Money** - Take money from your accounts
>>    - **2. Deposit Money** - Add money to your accounts  
>>    - **3. Transfer Money** - Send money between accounts or to others
>>    - **4. Reactivate Account** - Restore access if deactivated
>>    - **5. Check Balance** - View your current balances
>>    - **6. Display Account Info** - See detailed account information
>>    - **7. Exit** - Return to main menu
>3. **Exit** - Close the application


## ‚úèÔ∏è What I Learned
* **Error handling and validation:** Managing invalid inputs and protecting against overdrafts.
* **Test Driven Development (TDD):** Writing unit tests to ensure critical operations work as expected.
* **Object Oriented Programming (OOP):** Creating classes for customers, accounts, and bank management to keep code modular and scalable.
* **Banking systems logic:** Gained an understanding of how real banking systems work, this was both extremely useful and enjoyable.

## üí° Example of code I‚Äôm proud of

Here‚Äôs a piece of code I‚Äôm proud of, because it taught me a lot and helped me grow as a developer:
```bash
def reactivate(self, user_reactivate_amount, bank_management = None):
    if self.customer.is_active:
        return True, "‚úÖ Account is already active"
    
    # calculate required amount to reactivate account
    checking_balance = self.customer.balance_checking or 0
    if checking_balance >= 0:
        balance_to_cover = 0
    else:
        balance_to_cover = abs(checking_balance)

    total_fees = self.customer.overdraft_count * self.customer.overdraft_fee
    total_required = balance_to_cover + total_fees
    
    if user_reactivate_amount >= total_required:
        # deposit amount
        if self.customer.balance_checking is not None:
            self.customer.balance_checking += user_reactivate_amount
        
        # reactivate
        self.customer.is_active = True
        self.customer.overdraft_count = 0
        
        # save to csv file
        if bank_management:
            bank_management.update_customer(self.customer)

        return True, f"‚úÖ Account reactivated! Overdraft count reset to zero.\nüí≥ New Balance: ${(self.customer.balance_checking or 0):.2f}"
    else:
        return False, f"‚ö†Ô∏è Insufficient amount. Required: ${total_required:.2f}"
```
